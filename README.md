A real goofball. Big golden retriever energy. I fall into three-month rabbit holes and emerge, nose full of dirt, mouth full of, uh, proverbial rabbits? I work at [SEP](https://sep.com/) in Westfield, Indiana. Come visit!

### Generative AI

- I think auto-encoders are magic.

- Andrej Karpathy's [course](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) is incredible and I recommend you take it.

- I am uploading datasets and models to [HF/LeeHarrold](https://huggingface.co/LeeHarrold) as I make them.

- I am working on a [content conversation](https://github.com/Harrolee/drive-gooder) app that should prevent me from reading articles while I drive.

- The geniuses at [Coqui.ai](https://coqui.ai/) built an open-source voice clone tool. I built [echo-keeper](https://github.com/Harrolee/echo-keeper) to make dataset-creation actually kind of fun.

## <span style="color:green">Personal</span>

I saw Victor Wooten and Thundercat play at 2021 Indy Jazzfest. I took the evening as a cosmic invitation to purchase a bass guitar. I'm slowly getting better by playing in a classic rock cover band. We're called [Nucklehead](https://www.facebook.com/NuckleheadBand/).
